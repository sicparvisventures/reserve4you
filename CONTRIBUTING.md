   - Clear description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Environment details (OS, Node version, etc.)
   - Screenshots if applicable

### Suggesting Features

1. **Open a discussion** first for major features
2. **Explain the use case** - why is this needed?
3. **Consider the scope** - does it fit the "minimal" philosophy?
4. **Propose implementation** if you have ideas

2. **Follow the setup guide** in [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)
3. **Make your changes**:
   - Write clear, commented code

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **TypeScript**: Use proper types, avoid `any`
- **React**: Functional components with hooks
- **Naming**: 
  - Components: PascalCase (`UserProfile.tsx`)
  - Utilities: camelCase (`formatDate.ts`)
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`API_ENDPOINTS`)
- **Files**: One component per file, co-locate related files

### File Structure

```
feature/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/     # React components
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/           # Business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/         # Custom React hooks
â””â”€â”€ types/         # TypeScript types
```

### Best Practices

1. **Keep it simple** - This is a minimal template
2. **Don't over-engineer** - Avoid premature optimization
3. **Comment your code** - Especially complex logic
4. **Use existing utilities** - Check `/lib` before writing new ones
5. **Follow patterns** - Consistency is key

### Database Changes

1. **Create new migration** with `supabase migration new your_change_name`
2. **Add your changes** to the generated migration file
3. **Document migrations** clearly with comments
4. **Update TypeScript types** with `supabase gen types typescript`
5. **Test with fresh database** using `supabase db reset`

### Adding Dependencies

1. **Justify new dependencies** - Why is it needed?
2. **Check bundle size** impact
3. **Prefer lightweight alternatives**
4. **Update documentation**

## Testing

1. **Manually test** all changes
