# üéØ Complete Onboarding Fix Guide

## üö® Problem Summary

New accounts were getting **403 Unauthorized** errors during onboarding because:

1. ‚ùå Missing billing_state records for tenants
2. ‚ùå Billing check blocking first location creation
3. ‚ùå Subscription tab not visible for all accounts
4. ‚ùå No automatic billing_state creation for new tenants

## ‚úÖ Complete Solution

This fix ensures **ALL accounts** (new and existing) can complete onboarding successfully.

---

## üìã What Was Fixed

### 1. **Database Layer** ‚úÖ
- Created trigger to auto-create `billing_state` for new tenants
- Added all missing billing plan enum values (FREE, STARTER, GROWTH, etc.)
- Backfilled billing_state for ALL existing tenants
- Set all accounts to TRIALING status with 14+ day trials

### 2. **Code Layer** ‚úÖ
- **quota.ts**: First location ALWAYS allowed, regardless of billing status
- **ProfileClient.tsx**: Subscription tab ALWAYS visible for all users
- Better error messages and fallbacks

### 3. **User Experience** ‚úÖ
- New accounts: Automatic 14-day FREE trial
- Existing accounts: Upgraded to TRIALING status
- First location: No payment required
- Subscription tab: Always accessible

2. Creates tenant ‚Üí Trigger auto-creates billing_state
3. Status: FREE + TRIALING (14 days)
4. Can create 1 location immediately

## üîß Technical Details

### Database Trigger

Automatically creates billing_state when a tenant is created:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_auto_create_billing_state
    AFTER INSERT ON tenants
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION auto_create_billing_state();
```

### Quota Logic

```typescript
// ALWAYS allow first location, regardless of billing
if (currentCount === 0) {
  return { 
    allowed: true, 
    currentCount: 0, 
    limit: 1,
    reason: 'First location always allowed'
  };
}
```

### Subscription Tab

```typescript
// Always show subscription tab
const NAVIGATION = [
  // ... other items
  { id: 'subscription', label: 'Abonnementen', icon: CreditCard },
];
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Still Getting 403 Error?

**Check 1: Membership exists**
```sql
SELECT * FROM memberships 
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID' 
AND tenant_id = 'YOUR_TENANT_ID';
```

If empty, the user doesn't have access to this tenant.

**Check 2: Billing state exists**
```sql
SELECT * FROM billing_state 
WHERE tenant_id = 'YOUR_TENANT_ID';
```

If empty, run `FIX_ALL_ACCOUNTS_NOW.sql` again.

**Check 3: Trigger is installed**
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger 
WHERE tgname = 'trigger_auto_create_billing_state';
```

If empty, the trigger wasn't created. Run the SQL script again.

### "Billing state not found" Error?

Run this immediately:
```sql
INSERT INTO billing_state (tenant_id, plan, status, max_locations, max_bookings_per_month, trial_end)
SELECT id, 'FREE'::billing_plan, 'TRIALING'::billing_status, 1, 50, NOW() + INTERVAL '14 days'
FROM tenants
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM billing_state WHERE tenant_id = tenants.id);
```

### Subscription Tab Not Showing?

Make sure you've deployed the ProfileClient.tsx changes:
```bash
git pull
# Verify the NAVIGATION constant includes subscription
grep -A 6 "const NAVIGATION" app/profile/ProfileClient.tsx
```

## üìà Migration Timeline

### Before Fix:
- ‚ùå 403 errors during onboarding
- ‚ùå Can't create first location
- ‚ùå Missing billing_state records
- ‚ùå No subscription tab visibility

### After Fix:
- ‚úÖ Smooth onboarding experience
- ‚úÖ First location always allowed
- ‚úÖ All tenants have billing_state

---

## üîê Security Considerations

### Trigger Function
- Uses `SECURITY DEFINER` to bypass RLS
- Only creates billing_state, doesn't modify anything else
- Safe for production use

### Quota Check
- First location: No billing check
- Additional locations: Requires ACTIVE or TRIALING status
- Protects against unlimited free usage

### Profile Visibility
- Subscription tab visible to all authenticated users
- Only shows upgrade options if user owns tenants
- No sensitive data exposed

---

## üí° Best Practices

### For New Features:
1. Always create billing_state when creating tenant
2. Use the trigger as backup (it's idempotent)
3. Check quota before allowing location creation
4. Show friendly error messages

### For Database Changes:
1. Use migrations in `supabase/migrations/`
2. Test with existing data first
3. Include rollback procedures
4. Document all changes

### For Code Changes:
1. Always check for null/undefined billing_state
2. Provide graceful fallbacks
3. Log warnings in development
4. Show helpful error messages to users
